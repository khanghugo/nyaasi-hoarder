# nyaasi-hoarder

This script will torrent the selected anime. It can also save torrent links for use later

It can run with command-line option `python nyaasi-hoarder.py anime name -q 1080p -dl torrent`. If you want to execute the script only, it is really easy since I make most of the scripts under definitions.

you can use `-save` instead of `-dl` to save it into a file.

when you start the script, it will look for the animes on nyaasi. 

right now I set to Judas, if you wish for something different, you can tinker the script, really easy

it will run forever until you tell it to stop

my python is not working consistently because I had another output for `print` just because I add a harmless `return`

when you stop executing the script, your downloading will start.
