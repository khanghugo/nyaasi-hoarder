# nyaasi-hoarder

This script will torrent the selected anime. It can also save torrent links for use later

It can run with command-line option `python nyaasi-hoarder.py anime name -q 1080p -dl torrent`. If you want to execute the script only, it is really easy since I make most of the scripts under definitions.

This script will find what is there ,not what is not there. For example, most animes don't have episode 00, but this script will just keep finding it.

~Right now, only HorribleSubs on nyaa.si is the target to find. Maybe I will try to add more in the future.~

This script works for most of posters who use the same syntax. If you prefer other subs then just modifiy the script for now in the url parts

This works like a charm if the series is new. Otherwise, just get a batch to save yourself.

HTML scrapping is really slow for some reason. I try to find Shinchou Yuusha (12 episodes) and it takes almost 30 seconds to find all the links. 

yea,
