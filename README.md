# nyaasi-hoarder

This script will torrent the selected anime. I can also save for use later

It can run with command-line option `python nyaasi-hoarder.py anime name -q 1080p -dl` or script execution if you define `seriesName` and `selectedQuality` at the top

This script will find what is there ,not what is not there. For example, most animes don't have episode 00, but this script will just keep finding it.

Right now, only HorribleSubs on nyaa.si is the target to find. Maybe I will try to add more in the future.

HTML scrapping is really slow for some reason. I try to find Shinchou Yuusha (12 episodes) and it takes almost 30 seconds to find all the links. 

yea,
