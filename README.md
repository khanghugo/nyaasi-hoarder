# nyaasi-hoarder

This script will torrent the selected anime. It can also save torrent links for use later

It can run with command-line option `python nyaasi-hoarder.py "anime name" -fs "HorribleSubs" -q 1080p -dl torrent`.

You must include the quotation marks when the name of either sub team or anime has `-` in

`dl` method has either `torrent` or `magnet` for you to choose. For the script to execute the download, it will run with the browser, for now.

You can use `-save` instead of `-dl` to save it into a file.

Different fan sub team has different anime names, either in English or Japanese. So know your stuffs~
